# CryptoJacking-Detection
This repository holds the code for my artefact, a CryptoJacking Detection Chrome extension

•	The artefact source code can be found in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/i7465863/CryptoJacking-Detection
•	This code should be downloaded and extracted. After extraction the “Extension” folder should be moved from downloads into your file system.
•	Open the Chrome browser and navigate to chrome://extensions and then toggle Developer mode on. 
•	Select the “Load unpacked” option and navigate to the “Extension” folder within your file system. 
•	After selecting “Select Folder” a tile will appear on the Chrome page displaying the extension, and the shield icon will appear in your toolbar.
•	Restart all Chrome tabs and the tool will function in the background.
