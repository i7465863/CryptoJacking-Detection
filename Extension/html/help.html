			<h2>What is CryptoJacking?</h2>
			<p>CryptoJacking is a browser attack that operates in the background when you visit an infected website. The attack uses your computer's processing power to mine cryptocurrency for the attackers. The attack can increase your electricity consumption as well as slow your computer by occupying processing resources. </p>

			<h2>How do I use this extension?</h2>
			<h3>Background Monitoring</h3>
			<p>The extension runs in the background, monitoring the websites you browse and will notify you if you visit a site that is known to perform CryptoJacking. Scripts on such websites will be disabled and you can contine to browse unaffected. If a previously unidentified website is detected as having potential CryptoJacking activity, you will be notified and can choose to blacklist the website. This is done by monitoring CPU usage.</p>
			<h3>Blacklisting Websites</h3>
			<p>
			The extension implements a blacklisting process. Any website on the blacklist will continue to be accessable, but all scripts will be disabled. By clicking the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Blacklist this website</span> button, the current website will be added to the blacklist and all scripts will be blocked. Whilst visiting a blacklisted website, you can select the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Remove from blacklist</span> button to restore script functionality. </p>
